# Water Drop Mechanism

This is the mechanism I chose for the Final Project of the 3DMP Course. It is made of many components that, put together, simulate the wave-effect created by a drop  when it hits a body of water.
I chose this because it is very visual-pleasing and the way the mechanism works is very satisfying.


## How it works
The main components are: 
- frame
- axe
- handle
- disks
- circles (waves)

The motion is created by rotating the handle, which moves at the same time as the axe and disks. The disks are positioned one after the other, with the same distance between them, in order to create a waterfall effect. There should be noted that the disks are not concentric.
The legs of the circles have contact with the disks and as the disks rotate the legs and circles make an up-and-down motion.
