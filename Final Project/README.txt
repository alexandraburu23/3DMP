This is the folder for the final project of the 3DMP course.

Sketches folder: Homework 6;
3D Versions folder:-V8 - Progress 1: - create frame
                                     - create handle
                                     - construct the disks
                                     - create hole in the disks for the axe
                                     - create the circle component and mirror plane
                   -V13 - Progress 2: - move the disks in the correct position (+ mirrored the bodies)
                                      - create the link between the axe and the disks
                                      - build the circles with the legs and create the holes in the frame
                                      - upgrade the each disk and each circle from body to component
                                      - add the joints, rigidgroups and contactsets
                   -V25 - Final: -add joint limits
                                 -edit joint limits to rest
                                 -add apearances and set the scene
                                 -render images and video
                                 -export STLs
